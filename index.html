          <h3>YMCA Community Development (2017-2021)</h3>
          <p>I was a Technology Instructor and Consultant for both their Long Beach and Torrance locations. Delivered an engaging curriculum through existing framework of Youth Development to over 200 youth. 
            The Youth Institute program challenged me to teach and mentor very diverse youth through collaborative learning and encouraging a sense of mastery and competence.

          <h3>University of California, Irvine (2017-2021)</h3>
          <p>Graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering. 
            My experience in UCI showed me the importance of collaboration between students, because without the help of others I would have struggled much more.
            I learned concepts used in the work field, most notably Agile Methodologies, Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, and multiple Languages/Technologies such as C, C++, Git/Github, Bash, etc.

            <p>Stress tested a developing extension for AsterixDB known as Big Active Data AsterixDB. BAD is designed to deliver data of interest to a scalable number of users without compromising relationships between data, the enrichment of data, and retrospective Big Data analytics. 
                To test this system, my team created a new mobile application known as the UCI Study Party Finder, which mimics the party finding systems seen in video games. Users can search for a UCI-specific course and find the list of other students in the same course who are likewise looking for studymates. Additional options such as preferred party size, meeting time, location, and purpose of meeting are also available.
